                <h2>Why Muskoka?</h2>
                <p>
                    There is only one Muskoka. It is a special place where rugged granite outcrops and lonely windswept pines meet the shimmering beauty of freshwater lakes. Unspoiled natural beauty is what people find here in Muskoka. This place is our home. It is at the heart of what we brew.
                </p>

                <h2>WE HAVE RESOLVE</h2>
                <p>We work hard and are unwavering in our beliefs. The connection that we feel to this place that we share has made us strong and determined. We are passionate about beer and we will make our mark. Competition only strengthens our resolve to be a leader.</p>

                <h2>WEARE CARING</h2>
                <p>We care about each other and the well-being of our community. We are approachable, understanding, and patient. We strive to make our community a better place.</p>

                <h2>WE ARE AUTHENTIC</h2>
                <p>We draw inspiration from the natural wilderness that surrounds us. Our beers are a reflection of us; genuine and unfiltered.</p>

                <h2>WE ARE ALL UNIQUE</h2>
                <p>Our diversity makes us stronger as a team. We support and listen to each other. We teach and learn from each other. We laugh and celebrate together.</p>

                <h2>WE ARE THIRSTY</h2>
                <p>We are not afraid to venture off the beaten path to create and forge new ways of doing things. That is how we are built.</p>
